## Introduction

The `ThemeManager` class in the `Win_Labs.Themes` namespace provides a straightforward way to manage and apply themes across Win_Labs applications. This functionality is crucial for creating applications that can adapt to different user preferences and accessibility needs. This document outlines how to use the `ThemeManager` to apply themes, create custom themes, and implement best practices for theme management.

## Applying Themes

To apply a theme using the `ThemeManager`, you need to call the appropriate method and pass in the desired theme. The themes are typically defined in XAML files and included in the application resources. Here's a basic example of how to switch themes at runtime:

```csharp
using Win_Labs.Themes;

public class ThemeSwitcher
{
    public static void SwitchTheme(Uri themeUri)
    {
        ThemeManager.ApplyTheme(themeUri);
    }
}
```

In this example, `themeUri` is the URI of the XAML file that defines the theme you want to apply. You can call `SwitchTheme` with the URI of the new theme whenever you need to change the theme.

## Creating Custom Themes

Creating custom themes involves defining your styles, colors, and other resources in XAML files. These resources can then be applied using the `ThemeManager`. Here's a simplified example of what a custom theme XAML might look like:

```xml
<ResourceDictionary xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
                    xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml">
    <SolidColorBrush x:Key="PrimaryColor" Color="#FF6200EE"/>
    <!-- Define other styles and resources -->
</ResourceDictionary>
```

Once you have defined your custom theme, you can apply it using the method shown in the "Applying Themes" section by passing the URI of your custom theme XAML file.

## Best Practices

When managing themes in your application, consider the following best practices:

- **Consistency:** Ensure that your themes are consistent across the application. This includes using a consistent color palette, font sizes, and control styles.
- **Accessibility:** Design your themes with accessibility in mind. Provide high-contrast themes for users with visual impairments and ensure that your application's UI is navigable and usable under different themes.
- **Performance:** Be mindful of the impact of switching themes on your application's performance. Test your application to ensure that theme switching is smooth and does not cause noticeable delays or memory issues.

By following these guidelines and utilizing the `ThemeManager`, you can create a flexible and user-friendly theming system for your Win_Labs applications.
