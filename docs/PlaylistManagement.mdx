## Exporting Playlists

To export a playlist, the `PlaylistManager` utilizes the `ZIPManagement` namespace to create a ZIP file from the specified playlist folder. This process involves converting absolute paths in cue files to relative paths to ensure portability.

```typescript
export.createZIP(playlistFolderPath, playlistExportFolder);
```

This function performs several key operations:

1. Checks for existing ZIP files with the same name and prompts the user for overwrite permission.
2. Converts absolute paths in cue files to relative paths to ensure the playlist is portable.
3. Creates a ZIP file from the entire playlist folder.
4. Notifies the user upon successful export.

### Example: Exporting a Playlist

```typescript
var playlistFolderPath = @"C:\Playlists\MyPlaylist";
var playlistExportFolder = @"C:\Exports\MyPlaylist.zip";
ZIPManagement.export.createZIP(playlistFolderPath, playlistExportFolder);
```

## Importing Playlists

When importing a playlist, the `PlaylistManager` extracts the ZIP file into a temporary folder. It then ensures that any relative paths in cue files are converted back to absolute paths based on the new location.

```typescript
var destinationPath = import.openZIP(playlistImportFilePath, playlistFolderPathTemp);
```

The import process includes:

1. Creating necessary directories for the extracted files.
2. Handling file overwrite scenarios with user input to overwrite or skip files.
3. Converting relative paths in cue files back to absolute paths to match the new location.

### Example: Importing a Playlist

```typescript
var playlistImportFilePath = @"C:\Imports\MyPlaylist.zip";
var playlistFolderPathTemp = @"C:\Playlists\Imported\MyPlaylist";
var destinationPath = ZIPManagement.import.openZIP(playlistImportFilePath, playlistFolderPathTemp);
```

## Notes on ZIP Management

The ZIP management functionality is crucial for ensuring that playlists are easily portable and can be shared or backed up. By handling path conversions, `PlaylistManager` ensures that playlists are functional regardless of the machine or directory structure.

For further details on the ZIP management implementation, refer to the upcoming `ZIPManagement.mdx` documentation.
