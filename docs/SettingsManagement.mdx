## Updating Theme Settings

The application now supports theme customization, allowing users to personalize the appearance according to their preferences. To adjust theme settings, navigate to the `ThemeSettings` section within the settings file. Here, you can modify various aspects such as colors, fonts, and other UI elements to match your desired theme.

### Example: Changing the Theme Color

To change the primary color of the application theme, locate the `PrimaryColor` setting under `ThemeSettings` and update its value with the desired color code.

```json
{
  "ThemeSettings": {
    "PrimaryColor": "#3498db"
  }
}
```

This change will update the primary color used throughout the application's user interface.

## Renamed Settings Files

As part of the recent updates, several settings files have been renamed to better reflect their purpose and content. Below is a summary of the renamed files:

- **AppSettings.cs** has been renamed to **ApplicationSettings.cs**. This file contains core application settings.
- **AppSettingsManager.cs** has been renamed to **SettingsManager.cs**. This class is responsible for loading and saving application settings.
- **settings.json** has been renamed to **appsettings.json**. This JSON file stores the actual settings values.

### Adjusting to the Renamed Files

When working with the updated settings management system, ensure that you reference the new file names in your code and configuration. For instance, when accessing the settings file, use `appsettings.json` instead of `settings.json`.

```typescript
import { SettingsManager } from './SettingsManager';

const settings = SettingsManager.loadSettings('appsettings.json');
console.log(settings.ThemeSettings.PrimaryColor);
```

This adjustment ensures that your application correctly locates and utilizes the settings files, allowing for smooth operation and customization.
