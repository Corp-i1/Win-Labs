## Introduction

Win_Labs now supports a dynamic theming system, allowing developers to customize and apply themes across their applications. This feature enhances the visual consistency and allows for a more personalized user experience. The `ThemeManager` class, located within the `Win_Labs.Themes` namespace, is central to managing these themes.

## How to Apply Themes

Applying themes to your application is a straightforward process with the `ThemeManager`. Follow the steps below to apply a built-in theme.

### Applying a Built-in Theme

To apply a built-in theme, you simply need to call the appropriate method on the `ThemeManager`. Here's an example of how to switch to a dark theme:

```csharp
using Win_Labs.Themes;

public class MyApp
{
    public void ApplyDarkTheme()
    {
        ThemeManager.ApplyTheme("Dark");
    }
}
```

This method looks for a theme with the specified name and applies it to the entire application. Ensure that the theme name matches one of the built-in themes.

## Creating Custom Themes

Creating custom themes allows for greater flexibility and branding within your applications. Follow the steps below to create and apply a custom theme.

### Creating and Applying a Custom Theme

1. **Define Your Theme**: Create a new XAML file within your project that defines the styles and resources for your theme.

2. **Load Your Theme**: Use the `ThemeManager` to load and apply your theme at runtime.

Here's an example of how to load a custom theme named "MyCustomTheme":

```csharp
using Win_Labs.Themes;

public class MyApp
{
    public void ApplyCustomTheme()
    {
        ThemeManager.ApplyTheme("MyCustomTheme");
    }
}
```

Ensure that your theme's resources are properly referenced within your application for the theme to load correctly.

## Theme API Reference

The `ThemeManager` class provides several methods to manage themes within your application. Below is a reference for the most commonly used methods:

- **ApplyTheme(string themeName)**: Applies the specified theme to the application. If the theme does not exist, it falls back to the default theme.

- **GetAvailableThemes()**: Returns a list of all available themes, including both built-in and custom themes.

- **GetCurrentTheme()**: Retrieves the name of the currently applied theme.

### Usage Example

Here's how you can list all available themes and apply a selected theme:

```csharp
using Win_Labs.Themes;
using System;

public class MyApp
{
    public void ChooseAndApplyTheme()
    {
        var themes = ThemeManager.GetAvailableThemes();
        Console.WriteLine("Available themes:");
        foreach (var theme in themes)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(theme);
        }

        // Assume user selects a theme
        string selectedTheme = "Dark";
        ThemeManager.ApplyTheme(selectedTheme);
        Console.WriteLine($"Applied theme: {selectedTheme}");
    }
}
```

This documentation should provide you with a comprehensive understanding of how to utilize and extend the theme support within your Win_Labs applications. For further customization and advanced usage, refer to the `ThemeManager` class documentation within the Win_Labs.Themes namespace.
